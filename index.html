    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Doot shoot</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This project demonstrates the use of multiple processing concepts such as classes, images and sound as well as user interaction. This game is a simple themed target shooting game, where players must shoot all the targets with images of skulls on them, where each target "explodes" on click. Once all targets have been hit, the music playing stops and a victory message is shown with the time taken.

    <h3>Programming in Java term 2 project: DogeGame</h3>
    <p>
	My second programming project, which ends the second term of the programming in Java module (IN1007). This project shows a greater usage of Java using the city library's physics engine to create advanced bodies in the game as well as saving functionality, sounds, timers and other advanced classes. It is a game where the player as Doge has to click the screen to spawn bats to hit the enemy Cheems to collect coins from them and then reach the end of the level with all the coins, there are 3 levels and the objetive is to finish as fast as possible. If the player wins a time is shown but if the player hits a Cheems they die and a time is shown.
